## How to use your system (both for the web application and with REST API)

In terms of how to use the web application, it is very simple to view all features of the application, you should first register. To register a user you must visit ```/auth/register``` and register with your name, email and password. The password must be of length 7 and include a numeric character as well as a special character.

After registering a user, you will be redirected to the login page, which will allow you to add items to your cart and if you have administration rights, edit as well as add new products to the shop.

With respect to testing as well as using the REST API, we would recommend using a service such as Postman to send, GET, POST and DELETE requests.
